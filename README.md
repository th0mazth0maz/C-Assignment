# Context
This repository includes the C++ project files for a program simulating a simple restaurant menu and order management system. It formed part of an assignment for an Applied Programming Paradigms module utilising C++, which I completed as part of my 2nd year of a BSc Computer Science degree at the University of Lincoln. The assignment was graded with a 1st classification (77%)
# Overview
This project is a C++ application simulating a simple restaurant menu and order management system. It is built using object-oriented programming principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and constructor/destructor usage) and includes components like menu items, item lists, and order processing.
Core features include:
•	Add and manage different types of menu items (Appetiser, Main Course, Beverage).
•	Load menu data from CSV.
•	Create and manage customer orders.
•	View itemised bills and total costs.
